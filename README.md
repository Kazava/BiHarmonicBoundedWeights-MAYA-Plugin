This is a Maya command Plug-in implementation of the Siggraph 2011 paper. 
This plugin computes influence weights for skeletal characters. 
Voxelization is required to obtain the volume domain for the Biharmonic energy.

[Bounded biharmonic weights for real-time deformation]

Dev Envirnonment: WingIDE + PySide + Visual studio 2013, Python and C++.

`mosek 64bit` is required to solve the constrained Biharmonic formula, but I provide inside the project with an academic license.

Installation: 

as module based, just drag `install.mel` into Maya scene.

Note: still updating... not solidify yet
